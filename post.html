                        <p>Upon entering BYU, I wanted to gain as much experience in the Financial Services industry. My first expereince was at Reef Capital Partners, where I was a Private Credit Summer Analyst. I was able to work in a field which is called Opportunistic Credit<p>
                        <p>Working in Private Credit led me to my next internship opportunity at Columbia West Capital which is a boutique investment bank. It was here that I gained relevant transaction expereince such as financial  modeling and assembling marketing materials.</p>
                        <p>After working in Investment Banking, I knew I wanted to gain more transactional experience, so I got an internship at a search fund called Ironclad Growth partners. It was here that I gained hands on experience sourcing potential deals and evaluating them based on operational and financial metrics.</p>
                        <p>Ironclad taught me a great deal about how to communicate with small business owners. This was crucial at my next internship at Brigham Capital, where I was a L/S Analyst. I was able to effectively commuincate with founders and learn more about their comapneis and their respective industries.</p>
                        <p>Currently I am an intern at Diversis Capital, where I am one of three analysts staffed with assisting the Associates with their due diligence. The tasks may include market research, market mapping, valuation analysis, and document consolidation.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Future Opportunities</h2>
                        <p>The opportunity to intern at various institutions has allowed me to better understand what it is that I want for my long-term career. Due to my internship experience, I have solidified my interest in Investment Banking.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-clean-blog-gh-pages/assets/img/Century%20City%20Los%20Angeles.avif" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>Due to this growing interest in Investment Banking, I will be interning come Summer 2026 at Banco Santander in their Financial Sponsors group. I hope to gain more experience in the industry and remain long-term.</p>
                        <p>The internship with Banco Santander will be in their Los Angeles office located in Century City. I believe this location will offer me the best opportunity to progress in my career, but also remain true to my West Coast roots.</p>
